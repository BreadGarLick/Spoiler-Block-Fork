###Project Name 
Fresh Results
###Description
Google Chrome Extension that filters out search result suggestions that "spoil" or reveal plot elements of the media (shows, movies, books, etc.). 
###Business Model
#### Stakeholders
* Users - people who want to be "protected" from spoiler search suggestions.
* Businesses - companies who produce media that can be spoiled, they want their media to garner fame and interest

We don't want to charge users for using the extension. However, businesses' interest is to increase popularity for their media. So, we can charge companies to submit lists of key-words to block from search results. Companies don't want their shows to be spoiled, as that will cause people to lose interest.

We chose to use GPL because it is a good fit for expanding our ideas and allowing anyone to collaborate. As the project grows, there may be more opportunities to filter spoilers not just in search results, but on web-pages. Filtering out specific results may become difficult, and it would help if a lot of people could put their ideas on and develop solutions as a community.
